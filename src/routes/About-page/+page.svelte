        Hello! I am a hard working student developer with specific interests in web development and programming. I only found my passion for codding about three years ago when I entered the world of technology.

      <h2><strong>My Journey</strong></h2>
      <p>
        Looking at each stage of my studying, I got through a number of projects that assisted me in my further professional development. Be it a single HTML page website or a multi-layered Web 2.0 application, every project has been an excellent learning experience towards coding standards, approaching a problem resolution as well as working in teams.
